            Hello! My name is Jared Templeton. Looking for career change I found web development. 
            After enlisting in the Universty of Central Florida's Full Stack boot camp I knew this was the line of work I wanted to execute. 
            Now hoping for a chance to step into the development world and make some extraordinary responsive web apps. 
            While no where near an expert, I strive to learn and educate myself more everyday and hope to get started with a company soon.
